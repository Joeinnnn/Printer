  about:
    "Printing All Your Transactions LIVE turns every on-chain trade into a physical moment. We listen to buys and sells on Solana for this mint, compute the value in SOL and USD, and immediately print a receipt with token name/ticker, trader address, side, and amounts. It’s proof-of-degen — transparent, real-time, and fun.",
